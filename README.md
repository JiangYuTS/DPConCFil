#### Introduction

DPConFil: A Collection of Filament Identification and Analysis Algorithms

DPConFil is a Python package for identification and analysis of filaments in molecular clouds. 

We sincerely welcome community contributions to its optimization. If you find an issue with the code, or would like to request additional features, please raise an issue in the repository or send me an email. Email: yujiang@pmo.ac.cn

#### Direction for usage

Please refer to DPConFil_Manual.ipynb for the comprehensive manual and illustrative examples on utilizing DPConFil.

#### The reference of the Example data 

'Example_Filaments_13CO_1.fits' is the $^{13}CO$ ($J = 1-0$) emission line of the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) within $17.7^{\circ} \leq l \leq 18.5^{\circ}$, $0^{\circ} \leq b \leq 0.8^{\circ}$ and 5 km $s^{-1}$ $\leq v \leq$ 30 km $s^{-1}$. 

MWISP project is a multi-line survey in $^{12}CO/^{13}CO/C^{18}O$ along the northern galactic plane with PMO-13.7m telescope.

### Note 

We haven't uploaded the crucial part of the code yet, thus the program cannot currently run successfully.
